_Reign: Prime Citizen 2546, Imperator 2547, died 2592_

Ivan Messer was the founder of the [UEE](https://starcitizen.tools/UEE "UEE"), Prime Citizen and its first [Imperator](https://starcitizen.tools/Imperator "Imperator"). He rose to power as a victorious hero of the [First Tevarin War](https://starcitizen.tools/First_Tevarin_War "First Tevarin War"), leveraging fear of the [Xi'an](https://starcitizen.tools/Xi%27an "Xi'an") to justify his desire for power, and has been more recently implicated in having employed his wartime allies to perform [terrorist attacks](https://starcitizen.tools/index.php?title=Atrocity_at_Jata&action=edit&redlink=1 "Atrocity at Jata (page does not exist)") in a ruse intended to help him gain the title of Prime Citizen. After succeeding in becoming Imperator, he initiated numerous classified research projects on devastating weapons of war including [Project Vespa](https://starcitizen.tools/Project_Vespa "Project Vespa"). He also oversaw and endorsed a [terraforming](https://starcitizen.tools/Terraforming "Terraforming") boom, which inspired the founding of the [Gold Horizon Corporation](https://starcitizen.tools/Gold_Horizon "Gold Horizon"). He also built a strong relationship with [Aegis Dynamics](https://starcitizen.tools/Aegis_Dynamics "Aegis Dynamics").
