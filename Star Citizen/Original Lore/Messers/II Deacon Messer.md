# Deacon Messer

**Deacon Messer II** was the second [Imperator](https://starcitizen.tools/Imperator "Imperator") of the [UEE](https://starcitizen.tools/UEE "UEE") from 2592 until his abdication in 2628. He oversaw the victory during the [Second Tevarin War](https://starcitizen.tools/Second_Tevarin_War "Second Tevarin War") over the [Tevarin](https://starcitizen.tools/Tevarin "Tevarin") and used it as a way to cement his power.

## Reign

Deacon succeded his father in 2592. During his reign he enacted many changes in his office, like increasing military spending, expanding powers of the [Advocacy](https://starcitizen.tools/Advocacy "Advocacy"), increasing minimum sentences for criminals, approving funding increases on exploration and [terraforming](https://starcitizen.tools/Terraforming "Terraforming") projects, increasing taxes on the wealthy, and decreasing taxes on poor and middle class.

The [Second Tevarin War](https://starcitizen.tools/Second_Tevarin_War "Second Tevarin War") ended with the crushing defeat of the last Tevarin warlord and the submission and assimiliation of the Tevarin under the Empire.

## Abdication and later life

Deacon voluntarily stepped down in 2628 as Imperator and enthroned his daughter [Livia Messer](https://starcitizen.tools/Livia_Messer "Livia Messer"). He was made 'Advisor to the Imperator of the United Empire of Earth' in the same year. Livia's son [Marius Messer](https://starcitizen.tools/Marius_Messer "Marius Messer") and her husband died in 2643 after an 'incident' over Earth. Livia barely survived. She abdicated de facto in favor to her brother [Corsen Messer](https://starcitizen.tools/Corsen_Messer "Corsen Messer"). Deacon also retired from public life entirely. He died in 2661.
