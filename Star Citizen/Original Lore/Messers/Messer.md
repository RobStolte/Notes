The **Messer Era** was a period in [Human](https://starcitizen.tools/Human "Human") history between the founding of the [UEE](https://starcitizen.tools/UEE "UEE") by Ivar Messer in [2546](https://starcitizen.tools/26th_Century "26th Century") and the fall of Linton Messer XI on May 3, [2792](https://starcitizen.tools/28th_Century "28th Century"). During this period, ten members of the Messer family ruled as [Imperators](https://starcitizen.tools/Imperator "Imperator") of the UEE, plus one titled posthumously. Today, they are seen to have been malevolent dictators who pushed Human expansionism at unethical costs. Many conspiracy theories surround the notoriety of the Messers.
